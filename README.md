# A cleaner space, A cleaner future, MYNH CLEANER - Mapping Space Trash in real Time
 Did you know that we are at significant risk of ending all means of communication and shutting ourselves off from space? In our space there are 36500 objects greater than 10 cm, 1000000 objects from 1 cm to 10 cm and 330 million objects from 1 mm to 1 cm. The space is filled with trash pieces from the missions dispatched, and these pieces only collide to create more trash triggering a never-ending chain of space debris growth. But we have the solution, an interactive web application that provides real time location and predictions of them in real time in an interactive map providing information such as (geospatial, velocity, type, date, time) not only that but the app can predict crashing.
